# Big-Data-ETL
## Description of Project
For this project, I was challenged to test the ETL skills I have been taught. The goal was to extract two Amazon customer review datasets, transform both datasets each into four dataframes, then load the dataframes into an RDS instance via Amazon Web Services (AWS). 


## Languages and Libraries
